# pyHardWay
Central storage for exercises and stuff from Zed Shaw's 'Learn Python the Hard Way'.

http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html

A great book (probably a standard for learning Python -- what do I know?), available online for free, with various value-added versions available for sale.  I'm hop-scotching my way through it (experienced developer here, skipping the stuff that's obvious to me.  If this is your first--or even second language--skip nothing.), just storing the work here for global ease of access.
